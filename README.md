# aoe2-data
Age of Empires 2 civilizations data existing in Age of Kings, The Conquerors, Forgotten Empires, African Kingdoms and Rise of Rajas. The full dataset exists under `civilizations.json`.  

Some of this data (existing under `db.json`) can be accessed from [here](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/gvrettos/aoe2-data). It does not contain civilizations from Rise of Rajas as typicode's free plan has some [limitations](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/pricing). 

This data will be mainly consumed by the respective [Android application](https://github.com/gvrettos/aoe2metadata).
